Please read the following sections carefully, as they contain the terms and provisions governing your use (the "Terms of Use") of the Site. Additionally, you should review our <a href="http://www.firmexchange.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE AND THE PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SITE. BY USING THE SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOU AGREE TO BOTH THE TERMS OF USE AND THE PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BOTH THE TERMS OF USE AND THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SITE.</p>
<h2>TERMS OF AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>The Terms of Use and Privacy Policy constitute a legally binding agreement (the "Agreement") between you ("you" or the "User") and Firm Exchange. Firm Exchange has the right to modify this Agreement or these Terms of Use at any time. Changes in these Terms of Use may be posted on this page, without other written, verbal, or electronic communication. Every time you use the Site, you are agreeing to the then-current Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>THE SERVICES</h2>
<p>Firm Exchange provides the Site as an online portal which facilitates the buying and selling of small businesses (the "Services"). The Services include an online listing tool for sellers of businesses to market their businesses for sale, a Diligence Center where questions and answers as well as documents can be exchanged between parties, and financial analysis tools that guide sellers through the process of uploading historical financial data into easy to read, exportable formats for use by purchasers.</p>

<p>Firm Exchange is not a broker or a dealer. As such, Firm Exchange shall not be responsible for complying with any State or Federal Securities laws, rules or regulations regarding the actions and performance of a broker or dealer. Each user who posts information on the Site assumes all responsibility for the listed information and represents that they have the authority to post the information provided.</p>

<p>Information provided by The Firm Exchange LLC is presented to Users to help facilitate their business transactions. Information provided may not be suitable for all transactions and should not be construed as legal advice. The Services envision that once users of the Site share a desire to move forward with a purchase/sale, the parties will utilize the Services to assist in facilitating the transaction but conduct all legal and physical transfers related to the transaction on their own and outside of the Site. To the extent applicable, the parties will be responsible for hiring their own counsel and entering into any necessary agreements which will apply to all activities between the parties outside of the Site, this includes any additional Non-Disclosure Agreements for information exchanged between users of the Site in any manner outside of the Site.</p>
<h2>USER REGISTRATION</h2>
<p>You may be required to register in order to access certain features of the Site. You will choose a user name and a password through the Site’s registration process. You are responsible for keeping your user name and password confidential. You shall not share or allow another person to use your user name and password.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breach of security. Firm Exchange cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your account information protected.

<p>Users who are brokers and who use the Site as the agent or representative of another party represent and warrant that they have the necessary licenses, certifications, and any and all authorizations and rights to act on behalf of another party through the broker’s use of the Site. Firm Exchange does not verify the credentials of brokers using the Site and shall have no liability for the actions of brokers using the Site.</p>

<p>The Site may offer one or more ways to obtain the Services. For example, a one-time user may post one business for sale with an associated one-time fee for each listing, and a subscription user may pay a certain fee per given subscription term and obtain the ability to post the number of listings associated with the subscription fee. A one-time listing may only be used for one (1) business and may not be recycled or otherwise reused for a different business under any circumstances. A listing may not be transferred to another user for any reason. Subscribers will pre-pay for a given subscription term. Subscribers in good standing may post an unlimited number of listings provided each listing is posted in good faith and in accordance with the Terms of Use of this Site. Firm Exchange reserves the right to change and modify the one-time fee and/or the subscription fee and usage allowance for any subscribers, at any time, at its sole discretion.

<h2>USER CONTENT</h2>
<p>Firm Exchange provides the Site to provide the Services. The Services includes access and review of information and content provided by users of the Site. The Site and the Services benefit from users submitting and maintaining accurate and up-to-date information. The proper and efficient functioning of the Site relies on this user content. Firm Exchange assumes no responsibility regarding the accuracy of the information that is provided by the users of the Site and use of such information is at your own risk. If Firm Exchange discovers or believes your information, profile or any content you provide is misleading, inappropriate or in error, Firm Exchange reserves the right to remove, without notice, such content.</p>

<p>Firm Exchange has no obligation to monitor the Site and under no circumstances shall Firm Exchange be responsible for any failure to remove, or delay in removing, harmful, inaccurate, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content on the Site originating with or otherwise provided by other users. If you find user content, other than your own, that you believe to be in violation of these Terms and Conditions, you may contact Firm Exchange and Firm Exchange will, at its discretion, evaluate and potentially take corrective action with regard to the data.</p>

<p>A feature of the Site is for owners selling a business the ability to upload and consolidate proprietary information regarding the company and its sales, revenue, costs and other financial or proprietary information that is typically necessary for a purchaser to make a decision and obtain financing ("Proprietary Information").</p>
<h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p>Firm Exchange utilizes a two-factor login and utilizes third-party hosting service providers which incorporate data security procedures and standards in an attempt to provide a secure environment for the storage and access of your content. However, Firm Exchange does not represent or warrant that these steps will be one-hundred percent effective. You recognize and acknowledge that no network is completely secure and you waive any and all claims against Firm Exchange for data breaches that may occur while you use the Site.</p>
<h2>NON-DISCLOSURE</h2>
<p>You, as the party receiving Proprietary Information (defined above) of another user of the Site (a "Receiving Party") shall hold and maintain the Proprietary Information that another user of the Site has posted (a "Disclosing Party") in strictest confidence. A Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to any such Proprietary Information to persons bound by non-disclosure obligations at least as strict as those herein. A Receiving Party shall not, without prior written approval of a Disclosing Party, use for Receiving Party’s own benefit, publish, copy or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of a Disclosing Party, any of the Proprietary Information. Receiving Party may disclose the Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party to its own employees having a "need to know" in order to carry out their functions in connection with the purchase or sale of a business listed on the Site; provided, however, that such employees are advised of the confidentiality and non-use obligations hereunder and are advised of their obligation to maintain the confidentiality and non-use of the Proprietary Information to the same extent as Receiving Party is bound to protect such Proprietary Information pursuant to these terms. The obligations hereunder restricting disclosure and use shall be satisfied by Receiving Party through the exercise of the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of its own Proprietary Information and, in any event, not less than reasonable care.</p>
