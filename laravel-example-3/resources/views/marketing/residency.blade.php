    <p>
        FirmExchange.com is currently only open to residents of the United States of America.  We have built the platform to meet or exceed security and privacy standards of the U.S.  These standards may or may not be appropriate and applicable for residents of other countries.  When we expand to other countries, we will work to ensure an optimal experience for those residents.
