products_services,"Microbrewery, restaurant and event venue. Business also sells branded merchandise such as T-Shirts, Mugs and other items for sale in the restaurant as well as on its website. ",Great American style menu,"Provides a simple but loved menu of various fried chicken options, as well as salads and other health conscious items. Currently only offers dine-in but could expand to include local delivery."
market_overview,"The craft beer industry continues to grow in the United States. During and since the recession, the craft beer market has grown at the expense of the import beer market. The growing trend to “buy local” benefits the craft beer market as well. Morgan Street is the only lager brewery of the 18 microbreweries in St. Louis and has won awards for its craft beers. The quality food, craft beer, atmosphere varieties and prime location combine to make this restaurant/brewery a unique, popular destination.","Starting a restaurant from scratch is an incredibly daunting task, but with this investment, the work has been done for you!  The family has built their business on the promise of great food and you'll inherit that head start.","Great university location with a strong recurring customer base. The business is the only fast casual restaurant of its kind within walking distance to the school, making it attractive to the student body, while also being in a high-trafficed area for drive-in customers. "
competitive_position,"The area is home to a number of other establishments, however there is a real sense of cooperation amongst the business owners.  The idea is to grow the pie, not compete over the same customer!","With a prime location, potential customers would have to drive right past your restaurant to get to any of the nearby eateries--a clear advantage to be sure!","Competes with Chick-fil-A and other fast casual restaurants, but one of few within close proximity to the campus. "
business_performance_outlook,Recent passage of local bill will revitalize the downtown area and provide more green space and pedestrian access/attraction.  Use expanded capacity and distribution to both commercial and retail outlets to extend brand recognition farther outside of St. Louis area. Increase targeted marketing in programs of events/games at area sporting and convention venues. Expand catering operations through more aggressive promotion. Utilize upper level space as leasable office space to increase revenue.,"While growth has been slow lately, that's more a reflection on the ownership shifting to a later stage in their development and wanting to slow down.  In the hands of a right owner, there's countless opportunities for success: expanded lunch menu, renovating and enlarging the outdoor patio, etc.","After a period of strong growth after opening, the business has stabilized in recent years, but has never had a down year in revenue or owner's profit. Opportunity for buyer to join a great franchise and make a steady living. Future growth opportunities available from a potential delivery service and increased catering revenue."
